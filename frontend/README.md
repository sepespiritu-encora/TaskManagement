# Task Management Application

This is a Task Management application built with React for the frontend and a backend server (assumed to be running separately).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
- You have a backend server running that provides the necessary API endpoints.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management.git
   cd task-management/frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
Configuration
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```sh
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
Replace http://localhost:5000/api with the URL of your backend server.


Running the Application
1. Start the frontend development server:

This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser.
```sh
npm start
```
2. Ensure the backend server is running:
Make sure your backend server is running and accessible at the URL specified in the .env file.
